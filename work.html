              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The aim of this project was mastering JavaScript to create an
                app that could efficiently fetch data from an API and use it
                display it on the page using bootstrap cards and modals. The API
                data was stored in Json format, so it needed to be retrieved
                through the use of JavaScript API calls, and then added to the
                DOM by creating and appending the necessary HTML elements to
                display the data correctly.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started on this task by creating a basic HTML layout, which I
                could later use to insert the relevant elements and API data
                from JavaScript. Next, I began working on JavaScript promises,
                conducting thorough testing, and utilizing console logging to
                identify issues in the API calls. Through this iterative
                approach, I was able to troubleshoot issues effectively and
                successfully pull the data from the API. Once I could
                successfully pull the data I needed, I began integrating the API
                data into the page by creating the necessary Bootstrap elements
                and classes and appending them, along with the data, to the
                page. After testing and some alterations of the code and
                styling, this was enough to successfully meet the criteria
                outlined at the beginning of the project. An issue I had
                difficulty solving was related to performance - there was a
                small but noticeable delay in displaying the information on the
                initial load up page. After attempting a few different
                solutions, including adjusting async requests, it seemed this
                delay was mostly unavoidable (the time it took to get the
                information from the API and load it onto the page). To work
                around this issue, I added a loading screen with animated
                progress bar which appeared on load up, and then disappeared
                after the Pokémon data was successfully loaded.
              </p>

              <p>
                Having achieved the aims of the project and reviewing its
                functionality, I set about adding additional features I felt
                would improve the project. Firstly, I added a search bar to the
                HTML using bootstrap form classes, which would allow the user to
                search for their favourite Pokémon. For this to work, I used a
                filter method in the JavaScript which displayed only the Pokémon
                matching the text typed by the user and hid the rest.
                Additionally, I added a card color for each Pokémon based on
                their Pokémon type – this involved first accessing and checking
                the relevant Json data from the API, and then add the matching
                class color to that card to give each type its own color.
              </p>

              <p>
                The end result of these efforts was the successful creation of a
                Pokémon database application written almost entirely in
                JavaScript. Pulling the data successfully and dynamically
                displaying on the page was enough to create a successful
                project. However I think the added features of search navigation
                and loading screen made the app a much more user-friendly
                product.

              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The main requirements of this project was to build a database of
                movies and their information. The database had to be accessible
                from client-side applications and allow for CRUD operations. The
                database also needed to allow client-side applications to store
                and retrieve data on registered users, enabling them to register
                and login.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started by utilizing Node.js and Express to create essential
                requests and endpoints, allowing for the relevant CRUD requests
                the client-side application would need. The next step was to
                build the database. For this, MongoDB was chosen due to its
                reliability and performance but also for its flexibility as a
                relational database. This allowed for the creation of the
                project’s own schema, which was created using Mongoose. Once the
                schema, endpoints and collections in MongoDB were set up, I used
                postman to test CRUD operations of the database via the
                specified endpoints. However, a key component was still missing
                when performing CRUD operations on the user – user
                authentication and validation. This was handled by JSON web
                tokens, which generated a token for each user. This in turn
                required the middleware package Passport that works with express
                to validate tokens and authenticate users. To ensure its
                functionality, I once again used postman to test the endpoints.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, one key improvement I wanted to make also posed the
                biggest challenge - a method of encryption to improve security
                during authentication and authorisation. To tackle this, I
                turned to bcrypt which enabled password hashing and vastly
                enhanced the security of registered users. Setting up bycrypt to
                hash passwords correctly proved difficult. Fortunately, however,
                it has extensive documentation I could refer to throughout.
              </p>

              <p>
                The conclusion was a fully functional and secure database
                system. The backend infrastructure enabled the storage and
                retrieval of movie and user information. Token-based
                authorization and authentication mechanisms provided a high
                level of data security, ensuring user privacy. Additionally, due
                to the complexity of the steps required during implementation,
                and to enhance code readability and maintainability, I added
                JSDoc comments, providing comprehensive documentation for the
                codebase.

              <p>
                The goal was to develop a user-friendly and feature-rich movie
                browsing SPA using React and React Bootstrap. The app should
                allow users to register, and registered users to login to the
                app. Once logged in, the users would be able browse a list of
                information, click on a movie to see more detailed information,
                and navigate to a profile page where to they can view and update
                their account information, as well as delete their account.
              </p>

              <p>
                React was chosen for this project due to its reputation for
                providing smooth and responsive performance, being a
                well-documented and supported framework/library and its
                client-side rendering abilities. I set the project up using
                Parcel as the build tool, as it a simple, and includes many
                minifiers and optimisations which make it suitable for small
                projects. Once the project was set up, I started by creating the
                main page component, followed by the main movie list component,
                setting up the required logic to fetch the movies from the
                database and feed them into the component and then into the
                detailed movie component. React Bootstrap card classes were used
                to display the information and give it basic styling. Once this
                was complete, I then set about creating the login and user
                registration components. React router was used to ensure
                visitors without a valid token would be redirected to this
                welcome page. React bootstrap forms were used to allow user
                input and then the logic created to send and retrieve the
                relevant CRUD operation on the movie API database. The retrieved
                token would be stored in the browser, which would then allow the
                user to login. The last essential component was the profile
                page. This included a display to show users information, a form
                to update users’ information and a button to delete the account.
                Implementing this user updating form was perhaps the most
                challenging part of the project. Updating and encrypting the
                data sent to the server and returning and updating the user
                information on the same page proved difficult. However, I found
                it easier to resolve this by separating the page into several
                subcomponents to display user information and the update user
                form. This way I could pass the new data via props, which
                handled and resolved issues with updating the user info almost
                seamlessly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Having completed the essential components and tested the
                functionality, I decided on making some extra improvements to
                enhance the project. The first was to enhance user experience
                and security by applying validation logic to the forms, help
                preventing scripting attacks and giving feedback to the user for
                invalid inputs. Further user experience improvements were used
                with the use of React bootstrap alerts, updating with relevant
                error messages. I also added a favourites list to the profile
                page by adding a favourite button to the list of movies. Once a
                user clicked the favourite button, the movie would be added to a
                new list which would appear in the profile section in a new
                subcomponent. They could also remove the movie from the list but
                clicking on the same button. Lastly, although React bootstrap
                came without its own styling, I added customised CSS stylings to
                give the app its own modern and unique look.
              </p>

              <p>
                The end product was a satisfying integration of React and React
                Bootstrap which not only met the project expectations but also
                provided valuable experience, showcasing the successful creation
                of an interactive, responsive and visually appealing web
                platform in combination with up-to-date encryption and security
                standards.

              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The aims of this project were to create a progressive web app
                (PWA) that could be accessed both online via the web but also
                saved to desktop or smartphone screen as a web app. As a PWA,
                the app would offer quick loading, offline functionality, and
                cross-platform functionality. Access to the app would be via
                Google OAuth2.0. The app main page would allow users to search
                via list of cities, and an API request would pull a list of
                events occurring at that location and display them on the page.
                The display would show the event information in list format and
                further details revealed from a drop-down menu when clicked on.
                Additionally, continuous testing would be deployed in this
                project to ensure automated and consistent code.
              </p>

              <p>
                I began with the app's frontend, once again using React and
                React bootstrap due to its simplicity and capability of handling
                responsively SPAs. The initial components were set up to search
                by city using a user input form, and display event details,
                including start times, locations, and descriptions, with a
                user-friendly toggle feature to show further information
                regarding the event. Using dummy data set up for testing
                purposes, I was then able to feed data into the app to ensure it
                displayed correctly. At this point, after setting up the basic
                structure of the app, and following a Test-driven development
                (TDD) technique, I began writing unit tests followed by
                integration tests, to ensure the parts worked individually and
                together. JEST was chosen as the testing suite as it is well
                documented and can be used for both test approaches. I then
                began writing acceptance tests using cucumber and implementing
                the relevant features and then end-to-end tests using puppeteer.
                I found ensuring all that all tests passed correctly quite
                challenging, as writing the test, and then implementing the
                correct code to make the test pass was quite time consuming.
                However, using online resources such as cheat sheets helped
                enormously with speeding this process up and making sure my
                tests were written correctly. Ensuring that all tests passed
                with the dummy data, I then began working on the backend
                requests to obtain the API data from Google Calendar API. Rather
                than using traditional server architecture for this, Serverless
                lambda functions hosted by AWS were used due to their
                availability and low/no maintenance. This was connected to
                Google Services allowing for authentication via Google OAuth2.0.
                With this, a user could login via Google and see the relevant
                events pulled from Google Calendar API. Ensuring all tests
                passed, I could then begin implementing offline functionality
                and ‘save to desktop/home screen’ via the use of service
                workers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Despite passing all tests, and achieving all the objective
                functionality, I still felt the app wasn’t as attractive as it
                could be. To resolve this, a graphical overlay was implemented
                using a visualization library to transform the API data into a
                visual breakdown of event types and quantities in each location,
                along side the list view already implemented. This made the app
                more colourful and visually interesting. Along side some custom
                styling, the app looked much more appealing. The extra graphical
                overlay then had to be written into the tests to ensure it was
                included and functioned as intended. The final step was using
                google lighthouse PWA checklist and an online performance tool
                to ensure the app performed as expected.
              </p>

              <p>
                The final product was a visually pleasing and responsive PWA
                with instant loading, offline support, push notifications, “add
                to home screen” prompt, and cross-platform compatibility. The
                serverless function allowed for easy a low maintenance backend
                option and the TDD approach resulted in all errors being caught
                and eliminated during the build process.

              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The aim was to develop a cross-platform chat application using
                React Native, compatible with both Apple and Android operating
                systems. The app needed to offer a seamless mobile experience,
                allowing users to chat in real-time, exchange images, share
                location data, and record voice messages. Implementing features
                like real-time communication, media sharing, and authentication
                while ensuring smooth functionality on various devices were all
                requirements of this project.
              </p>

              <p>
                To begin with, I utilized React Native to build the Chat App,
                ensuring compatibility with both Apple and Android platforms. My
                familiarity with React Native allowed me to quickly establish
                the app's basic structure and functionality. The app was tested
                continuously using Expo as a simulator for iPhone and Android
                Studio as an emulator. While Expo was straight forward to set
                up, I had some initial problems with Android Studio. To resolve
                this required referring to guides and documentation to change
                the settings on my device. After some perseverance I eventually
                got it to work successfully so that I could connect and test my
                app. The chat interface and functionality were created using the
                Gifted Chat library, as it integrated well with React Native and
                provided users with the ability to customize their experience by
                entering their name and choosing a background. Real-time
                communication was enabled through Socket.IO, allowing users to
                chat instantly. I then set up the functionality to send images
                from the device's image library, capture pictures using the
                device's camera and share location data via a map view. With
                this complete, I decided on Google Firebase as a NoSQL document
                database to manage the cloud storage, and asyncStorage to allow
                access to message when offline. With this, user could log in and
                out anonymously and see their chat history based on their ID and
                retrieve previous messages and media both on and offline.
              </p>

              <p>
                An additional feature I implemented was voice recordings. As
                most devices now come with this feature, it was accessible using
                the expo-av library. It was well documented and allowed for easy
                integration alongside the already implemented features.
              </p>

              <p>
                This resulted in a versatile and user-friendly cross-platform
                chat application. Users could interact in real-time, exchange
                images, share location data, and record voice messages
                effortlessly, achieving all aims of the project. The app's
                compatibility with both Apple and Android devices ensured a wide
                user base. The integration of Socket.IO facilitated seamless
                real-time communication, enhancing the user experience. The use
                of Google Firestore for anonymous user authentication and
                Firebase for database and cloud storage management streamlined
                the app's backend processes. Overall, the Chat App successfully
                met the project requirements, allowed me to learn React Native
                and Firebase, while providing users with an engaging and
                interactive platform for communication and media sharing.

              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The objective was to develop an alternative client-side app to
                the MyFlix movie database. Using TypeScript and Angular, the
                goal was to create a robust and secure application with enhanced
                functionality. Overcoming the learning curve associated with
                Angular's structured folder organization and TypeScript's strict
                typing was an important challenge but crucial to ensuring
                robustness and security in the application. The app also needed
                to integrate user authentication features, allowing users to
                sign up, update their information, manage favourite movies, and
                retrieve detailed movie data from the server-side movie
                database.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once the project was set up, I started by creating the main
                movie list component, setting up the required logic to fetch the
                movies from the database and feed them into the component and
                then into the detailed movie component. The basic page layouts
                were built using HTML but using Angular Material classes and
                styles, making the layout quick and simple to create and
                offering a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
                Familiarising myself with Angular's structured folder system and
                Angular Material was new at first, but they are both well
                documented. Using Typescript, the logic to pull API data was
                placed in a fetch-api file accessible to all components via
                import, whereas the component functions were placed in the
                relevant component folder, which I found structurally logical
                and easy to follow. TypeScript's strict typing took some getting
                used to, but it is also well documented and I found it
                significantly reduced bugs and errors in the code, so required
                less debugging. Once the movie components were complete, I then
                set about creating the welcome page, login, and user
                registration components. Using Angular Material for the UI and
                importing much of the component logic from the already created
                fetch-api made this a relatively painless task. Similar to the
                React client, web token authentication was used to allow the
                user to login. A navigation bar was then added using routerLink
                to allow navigation between pages. The last essential component
                was the profile page including account deletion, displaying user
                information and update user information. Like previous
                components, Angular Material was used and CRUD operation logic
                using TypeScript created to update user information and for the
                account deletion.
              </p>

              <p>
                With all components completed, I decided on making some added
                features to make the site more appealing. The first was to add a
                favourites button alongside each the movie details for each
                movie. This could be used to favourite or unfavourite movies. I
                then added an extra section within the profile component, that
                would display the favourited movies – essentially a favourites
                list. Further user experience improvements were added with
                customised CSS stylings alongside the Angular Material layout to
                give the app its own modern and unique look.
              </p>

              <p>
                The finished application was a user-friendly and modern
                client-side movie application. By overcoming the learning curve
                and embracing Angular's structured approach and TypeScript's
                strict typing, the application achieved a high level of
                robustness and security. Typedoc documentation was used
                throughout, ensuring comprehensive and accessible codebase
                documentation, facilitating maintenance and future development.
                The application's user interface, designed with Angular
                Material, provided a visually appealing and responsive
                experience for users. Overall, the project successfully
                delivered a client-side component that met the requirements and
                provided a seamless movie browsing experience for users.

            <h2>Pokedex App</h2>
            <img
              src="img/work/pokedex-main_page.png"
              alt="Pokedex App homepage"
            />
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              An app that dynamically populates the page with Pokemon data from
              an API. The app allows you to search the list for a Pokemon by
              name, and when clicked on displays a modal box with the Pokemon's
              name, type, and an image. It is built using JavaScript, HTML and
              CSS with Bootstrap styling.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The aim of this project was mastering JavaScript to create an app
              that could efficiently fetch data from an API and display it
              correctly. One of the major hurdles was writing JavaScript
              promises to retrieve data from the API while ensuring the data
              returned was in the correct format. Identifying and rectifying
              errors in the data retrieval process posed a significant
              challenge. Additionally, optimizing the app's performance,
              particularly in handling API requests, presented a major obstacle.
            </p>
            <p>
              After creating thr base HTML layout, I began by working on
              JavaScript promises, conducting thorough testing, and utilizing
              console logging to identify issues in the API calls. Through this
              iterative approach, I was able to troubleshoot issues effectively
              and successfully pull the data from the API. I further expanded my
              skills by incorporating Bootstrap to style the app and make it
              responsive. Integrating the API data into both the main page and
              the Bootstrap modal box was a crucial step that required to pull
              everything together. To address the slow performance caused by API
              requests, I made the decision to replace individual Pokémon images
              with a static Pokémon ball image. While this sacrificed some
              aesthetics, it significantly improved the app's speed and
              responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The end result of these efforts was the successful creation of a
              Pokémon database application. Despite the challenges, I achieved
              my goal of developing a functional tool that allows users to find
              their favorite Pokémon. Through this project, I not only honed my
              JavaScript skills but also gained valuable experience in API
              integration, error handling, and performance optimization. While
              some aesthetic compromises were made to ensure optimal
              functionality, the final product fulfilled its purpose, providing
              users with a practical and efficient way to explore and discover
              their favorite Pokémon.

            <h2>Movie API</h2>
            <img src="img/work/myflix_api-db_view.png" alt="MongoDB database" />
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              The server-side component of a movies application. The webpage is
              hosted via Heroku and built using Node.js, Express using REST
              architecture. The business logic is modeled with Mongoose and the
              databuse built with MongoDB. The API is tested using Postman and
              includes token based authorisation and authentication. JSdoc is
              used to comment the codebase and for documentation. The database
              itself holds information on movies, and users, and allows for
              basic CRUD operations via the specified endpoints.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The purpose in building this database was to establish secure and
              efficient communication between the frontend and backend
              components. The first challenge was implementing token-based
              authorization and authentication to ensure user data security.
              This involved tasks such as password hashing and token creation,
              which were unfamiliar territories. Additionally, creating a
              middleware function to verify and authenticate user tokens
              presented a significant challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by utilizing Node.js and Express to create essential
              requests and endpoints. Following this, I built the database in
              MongoDB, establishing the foundation for data storage. Connecting
              the endpoints to the database required careful attention to
              detail, ensuring the correct information could be retrieved. To
              tackle the authentication challenge, I integrated bcrypt and
              jsonwebtoken packages, enabling password hashing and token
              generation for each user. Developing a middleware function to
              validate tokens and authenticate users demanded focused effort,
              but I successfully implemented this crucial security measure. To
              enhance code readability and maintainability, I added JSDoc
              comments, providing comprehensive documentation for the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conclusion was a fully functional and secure database system.
              Through overcoming the challenges, I created a robust backend
              infrastructure that enabled the storage and retrieval of movie and
              user information. Token-based authorization and authentication
              mechanisms provided a high level of data security, ensuring user
              privacy. Additionally, the implementation of JSDoc comments
              enhanced the codebase's clarity and accessibility. This project
              not only delivered a functional database but also provided
              valuable insights into secure API development and documentation
              practices, making it a significant learning experience.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              The client-side component of the Movie API database. The
              application is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users
              to sign up, update their information, and add and remove favorite
              movies, as well as to filter and retrieve movie information,
              including genre and director, from the existing server-side Movie
              API. It is built using React with Parcel as its build tool, and
              uses React Bootstrap as a UI library for styling and
              responsiveness.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The goal was to develop a user-friendly and feature-rich movie
              browsing SPA using React and React Bootstrap. React was chosen as
              the framework/library partially due to it's suitability for the
              project, and also for learning purposes - I had never used React
              prior to this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by creating essential components and endpoints to enable
              user registration, profile management, and favorite movie
              manipulation. I then extended the functionality by integrating
              components and endpoints that allowed users to retrieve detailed
              movie information, including genres and directors, from the
              existing server-side Movie API. Subsequently, I implemented
              components and endpoints for users to filter movies by title,
              enhancing the search experience. Finally, I applied React
              Bootstrap styling and ensured responsiveness to optimize the
              website's visual appeal and user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of these efforts was a fully functional and responsive
              movie browsing website. The integration of React and React
              Bootstrap not only met the my expectations but also provided
              valuable hands-on experience, showcasing the successful creation
              of an interactive and visually appealing web platform. It also
              served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to gain
              experience using a new approach to building SPA's and
              demonstrating the effective use of React and React Bootstrap to
              develop a feature-rich and responsive website.

            <img src="img/work/meet_app_ss.PNG" alt="Meet App homepage" />
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              A progressive web app (PWA) that allows you to search by location
              to see what events are happening in that city. Authentication is
              via Google and so requires a Google account, and the app can be
              saved on the desktop or homescreen for easy access and allows
              offline functionality.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The first task was to decide how to build an interface allowing
              users to search for events by location and then fetching data from
              a calendar API to update the app dynamically. Implementing secure
              user authentication as well as ensuring offline functionality, and
              enabling easy installation on desktops and smartphones were also
              essential requirements. The project also aimed for robust testing
              through a Test-driven development (TDD) approach throughout the
              development process.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address these challenges, I built the PWA by incorporating
              Google API Services for event data retrieval and authentication.
              The app's frontend was designed responsively using React to handle
              and showcase event details, including start times, locations, and
              descriptions, with a user-friendly toggle feature. A graphical
              overlay was implemented using a visulization library to transform
              the API data into a visual breakdown of event types and quantities
              in each location. AWS credentials were then set up in order to
              implement serverless technlogy and utlize lambda functions for the
              backend functionality. This allowed user authentication to be
              integrated through Google OAuth2.0, requiring a Google account for
              access. Progressive functionality was implemented along with
              service workers to allow the app to be installable and accessible
              directly from desktop and smartphone home screens, even when
              offline. Test-driven development (TDD) techniques were employed
              through, utilizing Jest, Cucumber, and Puppeteer for comprehensive
              testing, achieving a robust coverage rate of >=90%. Continuous
              integration (CI) pipelines were established for efficient
              deployment and updates.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of these efforts was a fully functional and secure
              progressive web app, with a visually appealing and user-friendly
              interface. Seamless data retrieval from the Google Calendar API
              and easy and secure authentication, as well as easy installation
              and offline access, further enhanced the user experience. Rigorous
              testing practices, including a TDD approach with Jest, Cucumber,
              and Puppeteer, contributed to ensuring correct functionality at
              each stage of development. The project was also a valuable
              experience for my future development, allowing me to implementing
              serverless functions, alongside rigourous testing methods and a CI
              approach.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>A Chat App built with React Native, Expo and Firebase.</p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The aim was to develop a cross-platform chat application using
              React Native, compatible with both Apple and Android operating
              systems. The app needed to offer a seamless mobile experience,
              allowing users to chat in real-time, exchange images, share
              location data, and record voice messages. Implementing features
              like real-time communication, media sharing, and authentication
              while ensuring smooth functionality on various devices were all
              requirements of this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin with, I utilized React Native to build the Chat App,
              ensuring compatibility with both Apple and Android platforms. My
              familiarity with React Native allowed me to quickly establish the
              app's basic structure and functionality. The app was tested
              continuously using Expo as a simulator for iPhone and Android
              Studio as an emulator. While Expo was staright forward to set up,
              I had some intial problems with Android Studio. However, changing
              the configuration on my development device resolved the main
              issues. The chat interface and functionality were created using
              the Gifted Chat library, providing users with the ability to
              customize their experience by entering their name and choosing a
              background. Real-time communication was enabled through Socket.IO,
              allowing users to chat instantly. The app was equipped with the
              capability to send images from the device's image library, capture
              pictures using the device's camera, share location data via a map
              view, and record voice messages. User authentication was handled
              anonymously by Google Firestore, and Firebase was utilized to
              manage the database and cloud storage seamlessly. I encountered
              some issues with the storage of chat and media messages in
              Firebase, and syncing those to seperate users. However, after
              correctly implementing the configuration and id, this was quikclz
              resolved.
            </p>
            <p>
              This resulted in a versatile and user-friendly cross-platform chat
              application. Users could interact in real-time, exchange images,
              share location data, and record voice messages effortlessly. I set
              out to achieve. The app's compatibility with both Apple and
              Android devices ensured a wide user base. The integration of
              Socket.IO facilitated seamless real-time communication, enhancing
              the user experience. The use of Google Firestore for anonymous
              user authentication and Firebase for database and cloud storage
              management streamlined the app's backend processes. Overall, the
              Chat App successfully met the project requirements, allowed me to
              learn React Native and Firebase, while providing users with an
              engaging and interactive platform for communication and media
              sharing.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              The client-side application for registering and viewing a movie
              database, using TypeScript and Angular, and uses Angular Material
              for styling. Typedoc is used to comment the codebase and for
              documentation.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The objective was develop an alternative version of the MyFlix
              React client. Using TypeScript and Angular, the goal was to create
              a robust and secure application with enhanced functionality.
              Overcoming the learning curve associated with Angular's structured
              folder organization and TypeScript's strict typing was a
              significant challenge. However, embracing these technologies was
              crucial to ensuring robustness and security in the application. A
              major difficulty also involved integrating user authentication
              features, allowing users to sign up, update their information,
              manage favorite movies, and retrieve detailed movie data from the
              server-side Movie API.
            </p>
            <p>
              To tackle this, I employed TypeScript and Angular to build the
              client-side components. Angular Material was utilized as the UI
              library, providing a visually appealing and responsive user
              interface. Typedoc was employed to document the codebase
              comprehensively. Familiarising myself with Angular's structured
              folder system and TypeScript's strict typing was a challnge at
              first, but I eventually leveraged it and defined interfaces to
              establish a clear data structure within the application. This
              approach significantly reduced bugs and errors in the code,
              enhancing the overall robustness of the application. Implementing
              user authentication functionalities, such as signup, profile
              updating, and managing favorite movies, was an integral part of
              the development process, but my familiarity with the Movie API
              database and previous React client project made this a lot easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              The end result of these efforts was a secure, feature-rich client
              application. By overcoming the learning curve and embracing
              Angular's structured approach and TypeScript's strict typing, the
              application achieved a high level of robustness and security. The
              integration of Typedoc documentation ensured comprehensive and
              accessible codebase documentation, facilitating maintenance and
              future development. The application's user interface, designed
              with Angular Material, provided a visually appealing and
              responsive experience for users. Overall, the project successfully
              delivered a client-side component that met the requirements and
              provided a seamless movie browsing experience for users.
