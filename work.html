              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The aim of this project was mastering JavaScript to create an
                app that could efficiently fetch data from an API and use it
                display it on the page using bootstrap cards and modals. The API
                data was stored in Json format, so it needed to be retrieved
                through the use of JavaScript API calls, and then added to the
                DOM by creating and appending the necessary HTML elements to
                display the data correctly.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started on this task by creating a basic HTML layout, which I
                could later use to insert the relevant elements and API data
                from JavaScript. Next, I began working on JavaScript promises,
                conducting thorough testing, and utilizing console logging to
                identify issues in the API calls. Through this iterative
                approach, I was able to troubleshoot issues effectively and
                successfully pull the data from the API. Once I could
                successfully pull the data I needed, I began integrating the API
                data into the page by creating the necessary Bootstrap elements
                and classes and appending them, along with the data, to the
                page. After testing and some alterations of the code and
                styling, this was enough to successfully meet the criteria
                outlined at the beginning of the project. An issue I had
                difficulty solving was related to performance - there was a
                small but noticeable delay in displaying the information on the
                initial load up page. After attempting a few different
                solutions, including adjusting async requests, it seemed this
                delay was mostly unavoidable (the time it took to get the
                information from the API and load it onto the page). To work
                around this issue, I added a loading screen with animated
                progress bar which appeared on load up, and then disappeared
                after the Pokémon data was successfully loaded.
              </p>

              <p>
                Having achieved the aims of the project and reviewing its
                functionality, I set about adding additional features I felt
                would improve the project. Firstly, I added a search bar to the
                HTML using bootstrap form classes, which would allow the user to
                search for their favourite Pokémon. For this to work, I used a
                filter method in the JavaScript which displayed only the Pokémon
                matching the text typed by the user and hid the rest.
                Additionally, I added a card color for each Pokémon based on
                their Pokémon type – this involved first accessing and checking
                the relevant Json data from the API, and then add the matching
                class color to that card to give each type its own color.
              </p>

              <p>
                The end result of these efforts was the successful creation of a
                Pokémon database application written almost entirely in
                JavaScript. Pulling the data successfully and dynamically
                displaying on the page was enough to create a successful
                project. However I think the added features of search navigation
                and loading screen made the app a much more user-friendly
                product.

              <h4>The Development Process</h4>

              <p>
                The main requirements of this project was to build a database of
                movies and their information. The database had to be accessible
                from client-side applications and allow for CRUD operations. The
                database also needed to allow client-side applications to store
                and retrieve data on registered users, enabling them to register
                and login.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started by utilizing Node.js and Express to create essential
                requests and endpoints, allowing for the relevant CRUD requests
                the client-side application would need. The next step was to
                build the database. For this, MongoDB was chosen due to its
                reliability and performance but also for its flexibility as a
                relational database. This allowed for the creation of the
                project’s own schema, which was created using Mongoose. Once the
                schema, endpoints and collections in MongoDB were set up, I used
                postman to test CRUD operations of the database via the
                specified endpoints. However, a key component was still missing
                when performing CRUD operations on the user – user
                authentication and validation. This was handled by JSON web
                tokens, which generated a token for each user. This in turn
                required the middleware package Passport that works with express
                to validate tokens and authenticate users. To ensure its
                functionality, I once again used postman to test the endpoints.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, one key improvement I wanted to make also posed the
                biggest challenge - a method of encryption to improve security
                during authentication and authorisation. To tackle this, I
                turned to bcrypt which enabled password hashing and vastly
                enhanced the security of registered users. Setting up bycrypt to
                hash passwords correctly proved difficult. Fortunately, however,
                it has extensive documentation I could refer to throughout.
              </p>

              <p>
                The conclusion was a fully functional and secure database
                system. The backend infrastructure enabled the storage and
                retrieval of movie and user information. Token-based
                authorization and authentication mechanisms provided a high
                level of data security, ensuring user privacy. Additionally, due
                to the complexity of the steps required during implementation,
                and to enhance code readability and maintainability, I added
                JSDoc comments, providing comprehensive documentation for the
                codebase.

                The goal was to develop a user-friendly and feature-rich movie
                browsing SPA using React and React Bootstrap. The app should
                allow users to register, and registered users to login to the
                app. Once logged in, the users would be able browse a list of
                information, click on a movie to see more detailed information,
                and navigate to a profile page where to they can view and update
                their account information, as well as delete their account.
              </p>

              <p>
                React was chosen for this project due to its reputation for
                providing smooth and responsive performance, being a
                well-documented and supported framework/library and its
                client-side rendering abilities. I set the project up using
                Parcel as the build tool, as it a simple, and includes many
                minifiers and optimisations which make it suitable for small
                projects. Once the project was set up, I started by creating the
                main page component, followed by the main movie list component,
                setting up the required logic to fetch the movies from the
                database and feed them into the component and then into the
                detailed movie component. React Bootstrap card classes were used
                to display the information and give it basic styling. Once this
                was complete, I then set about creating the login and user
                registration components. React router was used to ensure
                visitors without a valid token would be redirected to this
                welcome page. React bootstrap forms were used to allow user
                input and then the logic created to send and retrieve the
                relevant CRUD operation on the movie API database. The retrieved
                token would be stored in the browser, which would then allow the
                user to login. The last essential component was the profile
                page. This included a display to show users information, a form
                to update users’ information and a button to delete the account.
                Implementing this user updating form was perhaps the most
                challenging part of the project. Updating and encrypting the
                data sent to the server and returning and updating the user
                information on the same page proved difficult. However, I found
                it easier to resolve this by separating the page into several
                subcomponents to display user information and the update user
                form. This way I could pass the new data via props, which
                handled and resolved issues with updating the user info almost
                seamlessly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Having completed the essential components and tested the
                functionality, I decided on making some extra improvements to
                enhance the project. The first was to enhance user experience
                and security by applying validation logic to the forms, help
                preventing scripting attacks and giving feedback to the user for
                invalid inputs. Further user experience improvements were used
                with the use of React bootstrap alerts, updating with relevant
                error messages. I also added a favourites list to the profile
                page by adding a favourite button to the list of movies. Once a
                user clicked the favourite button, the movie would be added to a
                new list which would appear in the profile section in a new
                subcomponent. They could also remove the movie from the list but
                clicking on the same button. Lastly, although React bootstrap
                came without its own styling, I added customised CSS stylings to
                give the app its own modern and unique look.

              <p>
                The end product was a satisfying integration of React and React
                Bootstrap which not only met the project expectations but also
                provided valuable experience, showcasing the successful creation
                of an interactive, responsive and visually appealing web
                platform in combination with up-to-date encryption and security
                standards.

            <img
              src="img/work/pokedex-main_page.png"
              alt="Pokedex App homepage"
            />
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              An app that dynamically populates the page with Pokemon data from
              an API. The app allows you to search the list for a Pokemon by
              name, and when clicked on displays a modal box with the Pokemon's
              name, type, and an image. It is built using JavaScript, HTML and
              CSS with Bootstrap styling.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The aim of this project was mastering JavaScript to create an app
              that could efficiently fetch data from an API and display it
              correctly. One of the major hurdles was writing JavaScript
              promises to retrieve data from the API while ensuring the data
              returned was in the correct format. Identifying and rectifying
              errors in the data retrieval process posed a significant
              challenge. Additionally, optimizing the app's performance,
              particularly in handling API requests, presented a major obstacle.
            </p>
            <p>
              After creating thr base HTML layout, I began by working on
              JavaScript promises, conducting thorough testing, and utilizing
              console logging to identify issues in the API calls. Through this
              iterative approach, I was able to troubleshoot issues effectively
              and successfully pull the data from the API. I further expanded my
              skills by incorporating Bootstrap to style the app and make it
              responsive. Integrating the API data into both the main page and
              the Bootstrap modal box was a crucial step that required to pull
              everything together. To address the slow performance caused by API
              requests, I made the decision to replace individual Pokémon images
              with a static Pokémon ball image. While this sacrificed some
              aesthetics, it significantly improved the app's speed and
              responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The end result of these efforts was the successful creation of a
              Pokémon database application. Despite the challenges, I achieved
              my goal of developing a functional tool that allows users to find
              their favorite Pokémon. Through this project, I not only honed my
              JavaScript skills but also gained valuable experience in API
              integration, error handling, and performance optimization. While
              some aesthetic compromises were made to ensure optimal
              functionality, the final product fulfilled its purpose, providing
              users with a practical and efficient way to explore and discover
              their favorite Pokémon.

            <h2>Movie API</h2>
            <img src="img/work/myflix_api-db_view.png" alt="MongoDB database" />
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              The server-side component of a movies application. The webpage is
              hosted via Heroku and built using Node.js, Express using REST
              architecture. The business logic is modeled with Mongoose and the
              databuse built with MongoDB. The API is tested using Postman and
              includes token based authorisation and authentication. JSdoc is
              used to comment the codebase and for documentation. The database
              itself holds information on movies, and users, and allows for
              basic CRUD operations via the specified endpoints.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The purpose in building this database was to establish secure and
              efficient communication between the frontend and backend
              components. The first challenge was implementing token-based
              authorization and authentication to ensure user data security.
              This involved tasks such as password hashing and token creation,
              which were unfamiliar territories. Additionally, creating a
              middleware function to verify and authenticate user tokens
              presented a significant challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by utilizing Node.js and Express to create essential
              requests and endpoints. Following this, I built the database in
              MongoDB, establishing the foundation for data storage. Connecting
              the endpoints to the database required careful attention to
              detail, ensuring the correct information could be retrieved. To
              tackle the authentication challenge, I integrated bcrypt and
              jsonwebtoken packages, enabling password hashing and token
              generation for each user. Developing a middleware function to
              validate tokens and authenticate users demanded focused effort,
              but I successfully implemented this crucial security measure. To
              enhance code readability and maintainability, I added JSDoc
              comments, providing comprehensive documentation for the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conclusion was a fully functional and secure database system.
              Through overcoming the challenges, I created a robust backend
              infrastructure that enabled the storage and retrieval of movie and
              user information. Token-based authorization and authentication
              mechanisms provided a high level of data security, ensuring user
              privacy. Additionally, the implementation of JSDoc comments
              enhanced the codebase's clarity and accessibility. This project
              not only delivered a functional database but also provided
              valuable insights into secure API development and documentation
              practices, making it a significant learning experience.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              The client-side component of the Movie API database. The
              application is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users
              to sign up, update their information, and add and remove favorite
              movies, as well as to filter and retrieve movie information,
              including genre and director, from the existing server-side Movie
              API. It is built using React with Parcel as its build tool, and
              uses React Bootstrap as a UI library for styling and
              responsiveness.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The goal was to develop a user-friendly and feature-rich movie
              browsing SPA using React and React Bootstrap. React was chosen as
              the framework/library partially due to it's suitability for the
              project, and also for learning purposes - I had never used React
              prior to this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by creating essential components and endpoints to enable
              user registration, profile management, and favorite movie
              manipulation. I then extended the functionality by integrating
              components and endpoints that allowed users to retrieve detailed
              movie information, including genres and directors, from the
              existing server-side Movie API. Subsequently, I implemented
              components and endpoints for users to filter movies by title,
              enhancing the search experience. Finally, I applied React
              Bootstrap styling and ensured responsiveness to optimize the
              website's visual appeal and user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of these efforts was a fully functional and responsive
              movie browsing website. The integration of React and React
              Bootstrap not only met the my expectations but also provided
              valuable hands-on experience, showcasing the successful creation
              of an interactive and visually appealing web platform. It also
              served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to gain
              experience using a new approach to building SPA's and
              demonstrating the effective use of React and React Bootstrap to
              develop a feature-rich and responsive website.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              A progressive web app (PWA) that allows you to search by location
              to see what events are happening in that city. Authentication is
              via Google and so requires a Google account, and the app can be
              saved on the desktop or homescreen for easy access and allows
              offline functionality.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The first task was to decide how to build an interface allowing
              users to search for events by location and then fetching data from
              a calendar API to update the app dynamically. Implementing secure
              user authentication as well as ensuring offline functionality, and
              enabling easy installation on desktops and smartphones were also
              essential requirements. The project also aimed for robust testing
              through a Test-driven development (TDD) approach throughout the
              development process.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address these challenges, I built the PWA by incorporating
              Google API Services for event data retrieval and authentication.
              The app's frontend was designed responsively using React to handle
              and showcase event details, including start times, locations, and
              descriptions, with a user-friendly toggle feature. A graphical
              overlay was implemented using a visulization library to transform
              the API data into a visual breakdown of event types and quantities
              in each location. AWS credentials were then set up in order to
              implement serverless technlogy and utlize lambda functions for the
              backend functionality. This allowed user authentication to be
              integrated through Google OAuth2.0, requiring a Google account for
              access. Progressive functionality was implemented along with
              service workers to allow the app to be installable and accessible
              directly from desktop and smartphone home screens, even when
              offline. Test-driven development (TDD) techniques were employed
              through, utilizing Jest, Cucumber, and Puppeteer for comprehensive
              testing, achieving a robust coverage rate of >=90%. Continuous
              integration (CI) pipelines were established for efficient
              deployment and updates.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of these efforts was a fully functional and secure
              progressive web app, with a visually appealing and user-friendly
              interface. Seamless data retrieval from the Google Calendar API
              and easy and secure authentication, as well as easy installation
              and offline access, further enhanced the user experience. Rigorous
              testing practices, including a TDD approach with Jest, Cucumber,
              and Puppeteer, contributed to ensuring correct functionality at
              each stage of development. The project was also a valuable
              experience for my future development, allowing me to implementing
              serverless functions, alongside rigourous testing methods and a CI
              approach.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>A Chat App built with React Native, Expo and Firebase.</p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The aim was to develop a cross-platform chat application using
              React Native, compatible with both Apple and Android operating
              systems. The app needed to offer a seamless mobile experience,
              allowing users to chat in real-time, exchange images, share
              location data, and record voice messages. Implementing features
              like real-time communication, media sharing, and authentication
              while ensuring smooth functionality on various devices were all
              requirements of this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin with, I utilized React Native to build the Chat App,
              ensuring compatibility with both Apple and Android platforms. My
              familiarity with React Native allowed me to quickly establish the
              app's basic structure and functionality. The app was tested
              continuously using Expo as a simulator for iPhone and Android
              Studio as an emulator. While Expo was staright forward to set up,
              I had some intial problems with Android Studio. However, changing
              the configuration on my development device resolved the main
              issues. The chat interface and functionality were created using
              the Gifted Chat library, providing users with the ability to
              customize their experience by entering their name and choosing a
              background. Real-time communication was enabled through Socket.IO,
              allowing users to chat instantly. The app was equipped with the
              capability to send images from the device's image library, capture
              pictures using the device's camera, share location data via a map
              view, and record voice messages. User authentication was handled
              anonymously by Google Firestore, and Firebase was utilized to
              manage the database and cloud storage seamlessly. I encountered
              some issues with the storage of chat and media messages in
              Firebase, and syncing those to seperate users. However, after
              correctly implementing the configuration and id, this was quikclz
              resolved.

            <p>
              This resulted in a versatile and user-friendly cross-platform chat
              application. Users could interact in real-time, exchange images,
              share location data, and record voice messages effortlessly. I set
              out to achieve. The app's compatibility with both Apple and
              Android devices ensured a wide user base. The integration of
              Socket.IO facilitated seamless real-time communication, enhancing
              the user experience. The use of Google Firestore for anonymous
              user authentication and Firebase for database and cloud storage
              management streamlined the app's backend processes. Overall, the
              Chat App successfully met the project requirements, allowed me to
              learn React Native and Firebase, while providing users with an
              engaging and interactive platform for communication and media
              sharing.

            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>
              The client-side application for registering and viewing a movie
              database, using TypeScript and Angular, and uses Angular Material
              for styling. Typedoc is used to comment the codebase and for
              documentation.
            </p>
            <h4>The Build Process</h4>
            <p>
              The objective was develop an alternative version of the MyFlix
              React client. Using TypeScript and Angular, the goal was to create
              a robust and secure application with enhanced functionality.
              Overcoming the learning curve associated with Angular's structured
              folder organization and TypeScript's strict typing was a
              significant challenge. However, embracing these technologies was
              crucial to ensuring robustness and security in the application. A
              major difficulty also involved integrating user authentication
              features, allowing users to sign up, update their information,
              manage favorite movies, and retrieve detailed movie data from the
              server-side Movie API.
            </p>
            <p>
              To tackle this, I employed TypeScript and Angular to build the
              client-side components. Angular Material was utilized as the UI
              library, providing a visually appealing and responsive user
              interface. Typedoc was employed to document the codebase
              comprehensively. Familiarising myself with Angular's structured
              folder system and TypeScript's strict typing was a challnge at
              first, but I eventually leveraged it and defined interfaces to
              establish a clear data structure within the application. This
              approach significantly reduced bugs and errors in the code,
              enhancing the overall robustness of the application. Implementing
              user authentication functionalities, such as signup, profile
              updating, and managing favorite movies, was an integral part of
              the development process, but my familiarity with the Movie API
              database and previous React client project made this a lot easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              The end result of these efforts was a secure, feature-rich client
              application. By overcoming the learning curve and embracing
              Angular's structured approach and TypeScript's strict typing, the
              application achieved a high level of robustness and security. The
              integration of Typedoc documentation ensured comprehensive and
              accessible codebase documentation, facilitating maintenance and
              future development. The application's user interface, designed
              with Angular Material, provided a visually appealing and
              responsive experience for users. Overall, the project successfully
              delivered a client-side component that met the requirements and
              provided a seamless movie browsing experience for users.
